next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older

        The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8

                                    I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13

                                               It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20

                  Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we

that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                  So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

                               The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77

clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

                                                 The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\",\n          \"                                                                           Another thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0

look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual

                                                                                       Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                             Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .\\n33                                                                                 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                   Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .\\n40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42                                                                                                                                                            Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n43                                                                                                                                         I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44                                                                                                                                            More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                   Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .\\n46                                                                                                                                                  I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                          MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .\\n49                                                                I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                           Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                              easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .\\n53                                                                                                                       ,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .\\n54                                                                                                                ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                              I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .\\n56

streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n58                                                                                                                                 The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period .\\n59                                                                                                                                                    Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .\\n60

sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36

                                                                                                                                                                                                   I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39

                                                                                                                                                    The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83

found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

confused in directions .\\n87

thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0

look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very

an update .\\n47

need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50

noticing transmission surge during 2nd and 3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                              The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .\\n4                    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening

                                       Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

                                                                                 You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

intended !\\n10   Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n11

with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\n12

noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .\\n14

                            Kindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted

 I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0

reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh,

dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                    The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

vision to read .\\n49

                                               The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .\\n52                                                                 Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53

to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n56

its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59

        I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

         However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63

me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67

                                                                                                                                                                                  But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70

make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73

                                                   The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74

                       The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

                              The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\n80

           My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83

                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86

                            Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

                                                          Buttons are not hard to press for me .\\n93

.\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .\\n97

filled with nonsensical options .\\n98

that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book

                                                                                                                       I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .\\n17

differences eg .\\n18

                                                                                                                                                                                                         the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22

price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53

.\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

down .\\n59

significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

original Kindle was released, I was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .\\n63

             I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .\\n68

                                                 she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .\\n70

tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                  We were surprised and delighted when,

                                                                                                                                                                                                        The free morning coffee is also well appreciated and attended .\\n46

                                                                                                                                                                                          The free

think it warmed up even with the heat on until the next day .\\n56

the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .\\n58

the hotel lobby there is a free wine reception for an hour .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                     Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

make use of the free tea and coffee when we had an early start .\\n62

great coffee and biscotti in the lobby,  with carry, out cups .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                            Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                      Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                      The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .\\n68

are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                          It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has

enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a

to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

                                 I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36

his services .\\n37

                                                           This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

                                                                                                        We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                             I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Did not eat at the

                          Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57

                                                   The service in the hotel was really good .\\n59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties

is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\n75

a fee on each delivery .\\n138                                                                                                                                                   Being that I worked as

.\\n23

                                                                                                                       The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although

               The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n33

work in some units .\\n38

                                                            There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\n40

that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

all .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed

in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

     Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

consider that switch to PC .\\n7

organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

                                    I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used

just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49

pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

from the upgrade .\\n52

option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54

                                                                                                                                                        I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

                           A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58

you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .\\n53

                                                       Room service, however, was prompt and good .\\n77

have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive .\\n78

with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access .\\n79

floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests .\\n80

whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated .\\n81

service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !\\n83

with the service, location, as well as the room and its view .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .\\n85

utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n86

  The room was nice, but the service was horriable .\\n87

I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n88

Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   .\\n89

was not serviced when I returned .\\n90

stand to improve its service .\\n91

had a bit nicer service .\\n92

individuality and charme .\\n94

with maid carts .\\n96

lobby .\\n98

parking our motorcycle in the garage .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                    Our ONLY complaint was one doorman valet wasn't thrilled about us parking the car at the front \\n8

parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order \\u0096 we\\u0092d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                               I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .\\n13

.\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15

                                                                                                                                                                                    Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking .\\n17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37

                                                                     I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40

   The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                                         Check for

                                        I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

      Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59

                         Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking

by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74

worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected .\\n61

Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a
